Scrolling Letters Game
This is a terminal-based program that lets users control a scrolling letter ('J' or 'B') on an 8x8 grid using the arrow keys. The user can also toggle between the two letters using the spacebar.

How It Works
The user moves the letter across an 8x8 grid.
Use the arrow keys to control the direction of movement. Repeated arrow key presses will increase the speed of the letter in that direction. 
Multiple directions and speeds can be achieved at once.
The spacebar allows you to toggle between displaying the letter 'J' and 'B'.
The letter will loop around the grid if it reaches the boundary.
Press Enter to exit the program.

How to Run
Run make in the terminal to compile the program:

```bash
make
```
Start the program:

```bash
make run
```
Use the arrow keys to move the letter/ adjust speed, and press the spacebar to toggle between 'J' and 'B'. Press Enter to quit.
